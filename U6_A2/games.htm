<h1>Our Games</h1>

<p>8 years ago we set out to make three specific games. A Dark Fantasy adventure game. A futuristic action RPG with a PVP multiplayer and a High speed futuristic racing game.</p>

<p>We have now released all three of those games to great successs.</p>

<p>Games from left to right: Legends Of Aetheria, Neon Rebellion, Turbo Apex</p>

<b>Legends of Aetheria - Dark fantasy adventure</b>

<p>Aetheria was once a realm of harmony, sustained by powerful Aether Crystals and ruled by the Celestial Council. That peace shattered when Malakar the Forsaken, a dark sorcerer, corrupted the crystals, plunging the world into chaos. The Council fell, kingdoms crumbled, and monstrous wraiths roamed the land.

Now, in this Age of Ashes, warring factions fight for control while ancient dragons awaken. Hope lies in a chosen warrior—you—who can wield pure Aether energy. Armed with an ancient blade, you must reclaim the lost crystals, unite the fractured world, or seize power for yourself.

The fate of Aetheria is in your hands.</p>

<b>Neon Rebellion - Futuristic action RPG</b>

<p>The year is 2097. The world is ruled by Omnitech Corp, a megacorporation that controls everything—law, media, and even the air you breathe. Cities are neon-lit prisons, patrolled by AI-driven enforcers and cybernetically enhanced soldiers. The rich thrive in sky-high towers, while the streets below are left to the desperate, the outcasts, and the rebels.

You are Cipher, a rogue hacker and ex-Omnitech operative who has uncovered the corporation’s darkest secret—Project Eternity, a mind-control program designed to enslave the population permanently. Branded a traitor, you’re now the most wanted fugitive in the city.

Your only hope lies with the Neon Rebellion, an underground resistance of cyber-hackers, rogue mercenaries, and augmented outlaws. With stolen tech, high-speed hoverbikes, and black-market weapons, you must fight to expose Omnitech, dismantle its control, and spark a revolution.

The city is against you. The system is watching. But the future? That’s yours to take.</p>

<b>Turbo Apex - High speed futuristic racing game</b>

<p>The year is 2079, and racing is no longer just a sport—it’s survival. The world’s megacities are connected by the Apex Circuit, a high-speed, high-stakes racing league where the best drivers compete in hyper-modified, anti-gravity vehicles. But this is no ordinary race—there are no rules.

Once a promising racer, you were framed for sabotage and banned from the league. Now, with a rebuilt ride and a thirst for vengeance, you’re back to take on the Turbo Apex, the league’s deadliest underground division. Here, only the bold survive, and every race is a battle where speed, combat, and strategy decide the victor.

From neon-lit cityscapes to desert wastelands and gravity-defying loops, you must drift, boost, and fight your way to the top, taking down corrupt rivals, corporate-backed champions, and the mysterious racer known only as Ghost.

This isn’t just about winning—it’s about taking back your legacy.</p>
